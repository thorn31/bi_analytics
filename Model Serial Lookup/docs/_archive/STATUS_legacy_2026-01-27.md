# STATUS — Model/Serial Lookup (Legacy, archived 2026-01-28)

This file preserves the prior “resume notes” status doc before the action-driven workflow refactor.

Original filename: `docs/STATUS.md`

Key references in the legacy doc (kept for history):
- ruleset promotion workflow + manual fix persistence
- OCR helper commands
- older terminology (“Phase 1/2/3”)
