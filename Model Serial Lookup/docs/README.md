# docs/

This folder is the source of truth for **intent** and **workflow**.

Start here:
- `docs/WORKFLOW.md`: **Read this first** (canonical end-to-end workflow)
- `docs/ACTIONS.md`: action contracts + example commands
- `docs/RULESETS.md`: ruleset folder contract + CURRENT pointer contract
- `docs/OVERRIDES.md`: override precedence + schemas
- `docs/ARTIFACTS.md`: where outputs live + “latest” pointer files
- `docs/REPORTS.md`: what the reports measure + how to act on them
- `docs/STATUS.md`: current snapshot (current ruleset + known issues)
- `docs/TODO.md`: single checklist

Plans:
- Historical plan docs live under `docs/_archive/` (kept for reference).

Other:
- Older/stale docs are moved to `docs/_archive/` rather than deleted.
