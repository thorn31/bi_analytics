# docs/

This folder is the source of truth for **intent** and **workflow**.

Start here:
- `docs/STATUS.md`: current recommended ruleset + how to reproduce runs
- `docs/TODO.md`: single checklist for Phase 1/2/3 work

Plans:
- `docs/PLAN.md`: Phase 1 (Building-Center ingestion → versioned rules)
- `docs/PLAN_PHASE2.md`: Phase 2 (deterministic decoder engine)
- `docs/PLAN_PHASE3.md`: Phase 3 (rule discovery from labeled asset reports)

Other:
- `docs/MANUAL_OVERRIDES.md`: how to add one-time overrides so guidance becomes deterministic
