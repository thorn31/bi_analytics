AFCO brand systems were manufactured between 1900 and 1970. The Singer Furnace Company (subsidiary of Singer Sewing Machine Company) purchased AFCO in 1968 and placed it under the corporation's Climate Control Division.

The Singer American Furnace brand name was dropped by SnyderGeneral Corp. in 1984 after the buyout of 1982.

Note for Bradford White Tankless Units Only:
In 2006, Rinnai Corporation entered into agreement and began manufacturing tankless units for Bradford White. We have discovered that other companies such as Bosch have manufactured tankless units for Bradford White as well. As such, serial numbers for these tankless systems may or may not follow traditional Bradford White styles, but instead may use Rinnai or Bosch brand serial number styling respectively.
If you encounter one of these Bradford White tankless systems with a serial number style different than their traditional style 1 (AB12","03 06 B 1377 (Oil-fired water heater made by Aero Environmental under the Bradford White label - See Aero HVAC and oil-fired note near bottom of this page)

Unfortunately Slant/Fin closely guarded their numbering system and the manufacturing date could only be determined via contacting their technical assistance directly. Slant/Fin is no longer in business and can no longer be contacted for assistance with the manufacture date of these systems.
If an ANSI or CGA code compliance date is present on the rating plate, it may assist you in narrowing down a year range for the system. Additionally, the date stamp on the gas valve may be of assistance, but may only provide an approximate year the gas valve was replaced.
You may also be able to use our Hints & Tips page for other helpful clues in determining an approximate manufacture year range.
