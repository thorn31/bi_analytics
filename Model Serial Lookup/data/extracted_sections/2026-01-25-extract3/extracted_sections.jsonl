WeatherKing was a pioneer in the development of water-source and air-source heat pumps for the warm climate of the South.\n1963 - Addison invented a packaged air conditioning system for 100% fresh air that evolved into the first commercially available Dedicated Outdoor Air System.\n1988-1990 - Addison Products sold the residential \"WeatherKing\" brand line (but not the Orlando manufacturing facility)., and sold off its Michigan manufacturing facilities to Rheem Mfg.\nDecember 1995 - Addison Products was acquired by Heat Controller. The new company was called \"Addison Products Co., a division of Heat Controller Inc.\" - any product with a data tag bearing solely the name \"Addison Products Company\" or \"APCO\"  will have been manufactured prior to December of 1995. Between 1995 and 2004, Addison data plates will indicate the unit to be a division of Heat Controller or manufactured by/for Heat Controller, and typically utilize Heat Controller serial number styles.\n2004 - Company was acquired by Fedders and the name changed to Fedders Addison Co., becoming a new business unit under Fedders Commercial HVAC.\n2008 - Upon Fedders' bankruptcy circa 2008, the assets under the Fedders umbrella were sold and acquired by various entities. Airwell Group, a subsidiary of Elco Holdings Ltd. purchased the residential HVAC business which included Fedders, Air Temp, and Emerson Quiet Kool brands. Roberts-Gordon LLC (maker of commercial infrared heating systems) purchased the Fedders Addison Co. subsidiary, dropped the Fedders name, and reverted it back to simply \"Addison\".\n2014 - Roberts-Gordon was acquired by The Sterling Group, and formed Specified Air Solutions out of the multiple brands under Roberts-Gordon.\n2018 - In October of 2018, the Sterling Group announced it had sold the multiple branded Specified Air Solutions portfolio (which included Addison among others) to Madison Industries of Chicago. Between 2008 and 2018, Addison data plates on these commercial units should reference \"Specified Air Solutions\" and/or \"Roberts-Gordon\" as the parent company.\nAddison is currently manufactured as specialty commercial and industrial HVAC equipment under the Addison brand name which (along with Roberts-Gordon) is now a subsidiary of Madison Industries.\n1 information obtained from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

You can use the form HERE\nAFCO brand systems were manufactured between 1900 and 1970. The Singer Furnace Company (subsidiary of Singer Sewing Machine Company) purchased AFCO in 1968 and placed it under the corporation's Climate Control Division. In 1970, Singer renamed AFCO to Singer American Furnace. SnyderGeneral purchased the Singer Climate Control Division in 1982. The Singer American Furnace brand name was dropped by SnyderGeneral Corp. in 1984 after the buyout of 1982.\nOnly the Comfortmaker name (once a flagship product line of AFCO) currently remains as a distant remnant of this former company.\nSee full history below.\nAFCO® History¹\n1900 - Company established in St. Louis by Harry Van Bayse, John Laux, and William D. Harrison who all met while working at Front Rank Steel/Langenberg Manufacturing Company. Production limited to warm-air heaters\n1919 - Bayse buys out Laux's share of the company\n1921 - Bayse buys out Harrison's share of the company\n1942 - AFCO leaves residential production to manufacture furnaces for the military during WWII. Opens new facility in Redbud, IL.\n1945 - AFCO is manufacturing a variety of warm-air furnaces including coal, gas, and oil.\n1950's (early) - AFCO began manufacturing residential air conditioners - both central and window unit models.\n1950's (general) - Company producing 3,000 furnaces and air conditioners per month including brands such as \"Thermo\" and \"Air Stream\". Introduces \"Comfortmaker\" brand combination heat/air unit and firmly establishes its southern market for air conditioners.\n1955 - AFCO opens regional distribution center in Chicago serving a four-state area\n1968 - Singer Furnace Company (subsidiary of Singer Sewing Machine Company) purchases AFCO and places it under the corporation's Climate Control Division.\nAny system bearing the brand name \"AFCO\" or \"American Furnace Company\" will have been manufactured during the era's leading up to 1968-1970. After 1970 AFCO became a defunct brand.\n1970 - Became Singer American Furnace\n1982 - Singer Co.'s Climate Control Division is purchased by it's then president, Richard W. Snyder, and becomes SnyderGeneral Corp. More than half the bank debt ($14 million) was paid back within 9 months, and venture capitalists who invested in Snyder were bought out by early 1984.\n1984 - Singer and Singer American Furnace brand names dropped and no longer used; however, \"Comfortmaker\" brand from 1950's AFCO era was kept alive.\n1991 - Economic conditions hinder financial growth of the SnyderGeneral company. With global economic recession in full swing, SnyderGeneral sets its eyes on international markets to serve as the prime area for growth. SnyderGeneral subsequently sells Comfortmaker and Arcoaire brand lines to Inter-City Products.\n1994 - The remainder of SnyderGeneral operations are sold to Hong Leong Group Malaysia, which is partially comprised of O.Y.L. Industries Berhad, a manufacturer of residential and light commercial HVAC equipment. SnyderGeneral is renamed \"AAF-Mcquay Incorporated\" and divided into two major companies: \"AAF International\" and \"McQuay International\". AAF International was based in Louisville, KY and manufactured air filtration products and systems including commercial, industrial, and residential air filters, as well as air pollution control products, machinery filtration, and acoustical systems. McQuay International was based in Minneapolis, MN where it designed, manufactured, marketed, and serviced all HVAC systems and products formerly undertaken by SnyderGeneral (with exception to the Arcoaire and Comfortmaker brands previously sold to Inter-City Products). McQuay International sold its products under various brand names, including Wesper, JennFan, Barry Blower, and AAF (commercial and institutional HVAC equipment).\n1999 - Inter-City Products becomes wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation. Name was changed to \"International Comfort Products\" at this time (abbreviated as ICP).\nAny Comfortmaker brand bearing the parent company name \"Inter-City Products\" will have been manufactured between 1991-1999.\nComfortmaker brand remains owned by ICP (International Comfort Products), and is one of many heating and air conditioning brands under the ICP umbrella.\n¹Excerpts from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

He was asked to improve upon a magneto ignition device for stationary engines.\n1897 - Bosch began installing improved magneto ignition devices into automobiles and became the only supplier of a truly reliable ignition.\n1898 - Founded the first Bosch company outside Germany in London together with the Englishman Frederic Simms. This was the first step onto the global market. Further sales offices quickly followed in other European countries.\n1901 - Bosch factory constructed.\n1902 - The chief engineer at Bosch, Gottlob Honold, unveiled the much improved high-voltage magneto ignition system with spark plug. This product paved the way for Bosch to become a world-leading automotive supplier.\n1912 - Bosch began manufacturing magneto ignition systems at a factory in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n1926 - Alfred Meyer, then head of Bosch’s patent department, was given the special task of finding new fields of activity for the company. Meyer began developing a safety pilot for gas burners.\n1929 - Bosch developed a safety gas switch that was capable of activating itself in mere seconds; however, it could not be marketed due to a wide-ranging patent held by the heating and hot-water appliance company Junkers & Co.\n1932 - After much deliberation and the financial impact of the Great Depression, Hugo Junkers decided to sell his natural-gas appliance division to Bosch. The Junkers trademark name was retained. Junkers was well-known for cost effective and energy efficient gas-fired bath water heaters.\n1942 - Robert Bosch passes away.\n1945 - WWII has resulted in most Bosch factories in ruins and near zero international sales. Reconstruction is started along with diversification into more automotive components, home appliances, and HVAC.\n1950's - Junkers released products such as the Junkers Gasiator, a highly economical gas-fired radiator using its flame failure device for maximum safety - and invented in 1929 by Bosch.\n1950's - Bosch expands diversification including electronics.\n1975 - Junkers unveiled a prototype of a heat pump that used groundwater as a heat source.\n1977 - Buderus markets the Ecomatic low-temperature boiler. The innovative new approach made it possible to link the boiler’s operating temperature to the outdoor temperature, enabling energy savings of up to 30% and setting the standard for an entire industry.\n1980's - Bosch ventures into telecommunications\n2001 - Sells most of telecommunication division and acquired industrial technology specialist Mannesmann Rexroth.\n2003 - Bosch expanded its thermotechnology section with the acquisition of Buderus AG\n¹From various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

The company soon begins manufacturing gas-fired water heaters.\n1908 - Company name changed to Bryant Heater & Manufacturing, LLC\n1927 - New mascot 'the pup' is introduced in ad campaign indicating Bryant furnaces are so simple, you could \"let your pup be your furnace man.\"\n1933-34 - Dresser acquired the common stock of Bryant Heater Company. Then a victim of the Depression because of the decline in the home-construction business, the Bryant acquisition cost $65,000. Updating started at once, and by the end of the 1930s there was a completely new line of heating product offerings as well as a broader distribution program for sales.\n1949 - Bryant, Day & Night and Payne merger to form Affiliated Gas Equipment, Inc. (AGE). All companies were part of Dresser Industries at time of merger, but remain essentially separate entities under the parent company umbrella.\n1955 - Carrier merged with Affiliated Gas Equipment, Inc., which owned Bryant Heater Co., Day & Night Water Heater Co., and Payne Furnace & Supply Co., and moves Bryant’s corporate headquarters from Cleveland to Indianapolis (now Carrier headquarters).\n1974 - Carrier creates \"BDP\" company comprised of Bryant - Day & Night - Payne brands.\n1979 - United Technologies Corp. (UTC) acquires Carrier Refrigeration in forced takeover. Carrier becomes a subsidiary of UTC.\n1981 - Bryant pioneers one of the first 90%-efficient gas furnaces, with variable-speed operation. Bryant introduces the Dual Pack, the world’s first outdoor gas heating and electric cooling unit a few years later.\n1990's - Carrier stops using the Day & Night brand name. BDP company still in use.\n1996 - Bryant patents and introduces Puron ® as an environmentally sound refrigerant.\n1999 - Carrier/United Technologies acquires Inter-City Products, and changed the name to International Comfort Products (ICP). Carrier becomes the parent company of ICP, thus incorporating all ICP brands under the Carrier umbrella.\n2006 - Day & Night brand revived by ICP between 2006-2009 (sources for date vary) . Unverified, but presumed to be the end of \"BDP Company\", and brands under the umbrella are separated once again. Bryant and Payne remain listed under Carrier brands. Day & Night listed under ICP brands.\n2020 - Carrier completes separation from United Technologies as an independent, publicly traded company - Carrier Global Corporation. The separation process was started in 2018. Carrier retains all current brands, as well as ICP and their brands.\n2022 - Carrier celebrates 120 year anniversary.\n1- History excerpts from various sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

A precursor to the modern calculator, Carrier used this instrument to calculate dew point control - a breakthrough that was the foundation of his invention of modern air conditioning.\n1902 - The world’s first modern air conditioning system run by a stationary engine is installed and started by Willis Carrier in the summer of 1902 at the Sackett & Wilhelms printing plant in Brooklyn, New York. This is the invention of modern air conditioning. As a result of his inovations and contributions through the next 50 years, Willis Carrier becomes known as \"The Father of Air Conditioning\".\n1904 - Willis Carrier applies for patent on \"Apparatus for Treating Air\" He had invented the world's first spray-type air conditioning equipment that could both wash and humidify (or dehumidify) air. The patent was granted and issued in 1906.\n1906 - Buffalo Forge Company sells Carrier’s “Apparatus for Treating Air” to the Chronicle Cotton Mills of Belmont, North Carolina, and applies it to the mill’s fan-heater ventilating system. It was the first industrial “central station” humidifying system.\n1911 - Willis Carrier publishes \" Rational Psychrometric Formulae\" which brought science to what had been the often hit-or-miss design of air-conditioning systems, and in the process made Carrier an international name. The chart would be updated and reprinted regularly, serving as an essential tool to generations of engineers and remaining the basis of today’s designs.\n1913 - Willis Carrier developed the Carrier Air Humidifier designed to humidify the air in one room, such as an office or laboratory. It was the first self-contained unit with the fan and motor, eliminator, and sprays all combined into a single, packaged product. By 1914,\n1914 - By this year, industrial installations designed by Willis Carrier reach from North America to the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Central and South America. Carrier also achieves the first application of air conditioning in a residence for the Charles Gates mansion in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n1915 - Having so much success across the globe with this new air conditioning technology, Willis Carrier joins forces with 6 other fellow engineers from Buffalo Forge Company to launch Carrier Engineering Corporation, and mass production is started.\n1917 - Carrier hires America's first woman engineer - Margaret Ingles who later served on President Herbert Hoover's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership in the late 1920's, as well as wrote and published Willis Carrier's biography in 1952.\n1922 - Carrier unveils the first centrifugal refrigeration machine, more commonly known today as a chiller. This first chiller was installed in Onondaga Pottery Company in Syracuse, New York\n1925 - Madison Square Gardens opens. It employs Carrier centrifugal chillers to cool patrons and produce the ice surface for professional hockey.\n1926 - T.W. Patterson Building in Fresno, California becomes Carrier’s first multi-story installation with cooled floors two through seven for its tenants. Carrier also introduces the first home air conditioner.\n1928 - Milam Building in San Antonio, Texas, included Carrier central air conditioning, making it the first skyscraper to install comfort cooling as it was built.\n1930 - Carrier recorded the first sale of its window-sill-height Weathermaster units to the Superheater Company of East Chicago, Indiana, to air condition the second floor of a two-story building. Later that year, the California Bank of Los Angeles contracted for 490 Weathermasters to air condition its 15-story building. The U.S. Supreme Court was also cooled using 180 Carrier Weathermaster units.\n1931 - The M.V. Victoria , a 13,400-ton Italian motorship designed to run from Italy to Egypt, became the first vessel to make its maiden voyage equipped with Carrier air conditioning.\n1939 - World Fair opens in New York with “Carrier Igloo of Tomorrow” as a major and popular attraction. Inside the Igloo and in the adjacent Hall of Weathermakers, guests learned the steps involved in air conditioning, toured a modern food store using Carrier refrigeration, and viewed an exhibit with Carrier self-contained air conditioning.\n1950 - October 7, Willis Carrier passed away. It was the close of an era for both the industry and company, but just the start of an enduring legacy.\n1955 - Carrier merged with Affiliated Gas Equipment, Inc., which owned Bryant Heater Co., Day & Night Water Heater Co., and Payne Furnace & Supply Co.\n1956 - Carrier won the largest contract ever awarded for residential air conditioning, jointly announced with the community building firm of Levitt & Sons, Inc. Carrier was able to provide Weathermaker central air-conditioning systems for 702 “Country Clubber” homes in Levittown, Pennsylvania.\n1968 - Carrier Transicold produces the first front-wall diesel/electric refrigeration unit for shipping containers.\n1974 - Carrier creates \"BDP\" company comprised of Bryant - Day & Night - Payne brands.\n1979 - United Technologies Corp. (UTC) acquires Carrier Refrigeration in forced takeover. Carrier becomes a subsidiary of UTC.\n1993 - Carrier ceases to manufacture CFC-based chillers in the U.S., two years before the deadline established by the U.S. Clean Air Act.\n1990's - Carrier stops using the Day & Night Brand. BDP company still in use.\n1999 - Carrier/United Technologies acquires Inter-City Products, and changed the name to International Comfort Products (ICP). Carrier becomes the parent company of ICP, thus incorporating all ICP brands under the Carrier umbrella\n2006 - Day & Night brand revived by ICP between 2006-2009 (sources for date vary) . Unsure, but presumed to be the end of \"BDP Company\". Bryant and Payne currently listed under Carrier brands. Day & Night listed under ICP brands.\n2011 - Carrier introduced the Infinity ® heat pump with Greenspeed™ intelligence offering the greatest heating efficiency of any air source heat pump to date.\n2012 - Carrier celebrates the 110th anniversary of the invention of modern air conditioning.\n2020 - Carrier completes separation from United Technologies as an independent, publicly traded company - Carrier Global Corporation. The separation process was started in 2018. Carrier retains ICP and their brands.\n2022 - Carrier celebrates 120 year anniversary.\n1- History excerpts from various sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

If you have information which may assist us, please send us a note !\nNote: We believe the date of manufacture is likely coded within the first two positions (letters) of the serial number. The system data plates indicate to have been \"Made in PRC\" (The Peoples Republic of China). The few condenser units we have encountered are typically aged beyond industry average service design life, and utilized R22 refrigerant which is now obsolete. We suspect units bearing this serial number style to have been manufactured between late 1990's to early 2000's.\nComfort-Aire® History¹\n1917 - Century Engineering Corp. founded in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Produced and manufactured warm air furnaces, and later oil and gas conversion kits for coal-fired furnaces. Later delved into PTAC systems, humidifiers, as well as portable space heaters.\n1975 - Heat Controller, Inc. of Jackson, Michigan acquired the Century® brand name and assets, and incorporated those product offerings and market distribution into the Heat Controller family.\n2000 - Heat Controller acquired Aiton's Equipment of Canada , providing increased market penetration in North America. Comfort-Aire and Century brand names were distributed under the new Aiton's of Canada umbrella (\"by Aitons\") throughout Canada.\n2013 - MARS (Motors and Armatures, Inc.), a leading commercial and residential HVACR motors and components supplier, acquires Heat Controller, Inc. and forms a merger between the two companies.\nCurrent (2024) - The Heat Controller name was eventually dropped (circa 2016) resulting in two divisions of MARS - the motors and components (parts) division for which MARS was known for, and the MARS equipment division selling under the previous Heat Controller private label brand names of Comfort-Aire, Century, and Allied Commercial. The product lines include an impressively broad selection of HVACR equipment including heat pumps, split system air conditioners, air handlers, furnaces, geothermal, PTACs, portable room air conditioners, dehumidifiers, window air conditioners, ductless systems, commercial Rooftop units, packaged units, and more.\nAbout MARS - Founded in 1945, MARS is a family-owned and operated supplier of motors, components, service/installation parts, and equipment for the HVACR industry. Originally launched as a motor repair company, MARS continually evolved its business throughout the years to meet the needs of customers. Now the MARS Motors and Components Division distributes an extensive line of MARS and JARD branded aftermarket replacement products, as well as original equipment components of leading manufacturers. MARS Equipment Division offers residential and commercial heating, cooling, and dehumidification equipment under the Comfort-Aire and Century brand names in the United States and under the Comfort-Aire by Aitons brand name in Canada. MARS Motors and Components Division operates from Hauppauge, New York, with distribution facilities in Earth City (St. Louis), MO and Halton Hills, Ontario. The MARS Equipment Division operates out of Jackson, Michigan, the former headquarters of Heat Controller, Inc.\n¹Excerpts from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

Operational data about that particular unit can be found on the nameplate. Inspectors frequently reference this information to ensure the equipment is operating within the parameters set by the original manufacturer.\nThe nameplate also provides essential information for ordering replacement parts. Sometimes, the specific pressure rating is required for a part, or the serial number is needed. If the parts department is unable to locate a particular job file, the nameplate data can reveal the original setup information. Fuel series information and boiler model type also help to guide the Cleaver-Brooks staff.\nIf the birthdate of a Cleaver-Brooks boiler is 1996 or later, there is a bill of materials in the Cleaver-Brooks Navigator research tool. Using this resource, an authorized company representative can access the spare parts list and obtain a list of tune-up spares as well as a list of annual inspection spares.\nBelow is a sample firetube nameplate along with information about each field. Many of the fields are straightforward; however, some usually require an explanation.\nModel No: The first number (4WI) is the boiler model number. The second number (400) is the fuel type. The third number (400) is the size. In this case, the unit of measurement is horsepower. The fourth number (250) is the design pressure in pounds. The initials at the end represent either steam (ST) or hot water (HW).\nMaximum Working Pressure: For this particular boiler, the working pressure is 250 (measured in PSI).\nGross Output: Maximum boiler capacity output is 13,390,000 BTU/hr.\nGas Type: Listed as natural or propane, landfill/digester or methane.\nMinimum Input: Input is based on fuel type, which is 1,633,000 BTU/hr for this boiler.\nMaximum Input: Input is based on fuel type, which is 16,329,000 BTU/hr in this case.\nManifold Pressure: Minimum required gas pressure at the burner.\nInlet Pressure: Required to regulate gas pressure at the inlet to the gas train.\nNOx Emission Level: UC stands for uncontrolled emissions. If 9, 15, 30 or 60 were in this box, the NOx emission level would be that number or less.\nOil Grade: Fuel oil type options are No. 2 (light oil), No. 4 (kerosene) or No. 6 (heavy oil).\nMinimum Input: Input is based on fuel type, which is 27.2 USGPH in this case.\nNozzle Size: Part number to the oil gun nozzle.\nSpray Pattern: Oil gun nozzle pattern, which is conical in this case.\nSpray Angle: Measured in degrees.\nOil Pressure at Maximum Input: Measured in PSI.\nSerial Number: The Cleaver-Brooks unit ID. Each unit has a unique number.\nPSI Date: Year the boiler was built, which is 2013 for this boiler.\nThe nameplate design has changed over time, but the information included has remained the same. If the numbers or words are hard to read on a nameplate, the best way to retrieve the information is via a paper/pencil rubbing. Cleaver-Brooks can then re-stamp and send a new plate.", "section_html": null, "has_images": true, "image_urls": ["https://building-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CleaverBrooks-PSI-Date_How-to-determine-the-date-of-manufacture_production_age.png"], "raw_html_path": "data/raw_html/2026-01-25/www_building_center_org_cleaver_brooks_hvac_age__fe71762785.html"}

Shifts its production emphasis from furnaces to include room air conditioners, central air conditioning, and dehumidifiers under the Comfort-Aire brand name .\n1960's - Heat Controller restructured its furnace line, focusing on residential gas-fired and oil-fired furnaces, while still maintaining an emphasis on the air conditioning portion of the business.\n1972 - Manufactures the first ductless mini-split for the American market - the Comfort-Aire Twin Pak.\n1975 - Heat Controller acquired the Century® brand name and assets, and incorporated those product offerings and market distribution into the Heat Controller family. Century's history dates back to 1917 and continues today to offer a complete line of residential and light commercial heating and air conditioning products.\n2000 - Heat Controller acquired Aiton's Equipment of Canada , providing increased market penetration in North America. Comfort-Aire and Century brand names were distributed under the new Aiton's of Canada umbrella (\"by Aitons\") throughout Canada.\n2013 - MARS (Motors and Armatures, Inc.), a leading commercial and residential HVACR motors and components supplier, acquires Heat Controller, Inc. and forms a merger between the two companies.\nCurrent (2024) - The Heat Controller name was eventually dropped (circa 2016) resulting in two divisions of MARS - the motors and components (parts) division for which MARS was known for, and the MARS equipment division selling under the previous Heat Controller private label brand names of Comfort-Aire, Century, and Allied Commercial. The product lines include an impressively broad selection of HVACR equipment including heat pumps, split system air conditioners, air handlers, furnaces, geothermal, PTACs, portable room air conditioners, dehumidifiers, window air conditioners, ductless systems, commercial Rooftop units, packaged units, and more.\nAbout MARS - Founded in 1945, MARS is a family-owned and operated supplier of motors, components, service/installation parts, and equipment for the HVACR industry. Originally launched as a motor repair company, MARS continually evolved its business throughout the years to meet the needs of customers. Now the MARS Motors and Components Division distributes an extensive line of MARS and JARD branded aftermarket replacement products, as well as original equipment components of leading manufacturers. MARS Equipment Division offers residential and commercial heating, cooling, and dehumidification equipment under the Comfort-Aire and Century brand names in the United States and under the Comfort-Aire by Aitons brand name in Canada. MARS Motors and Components Division operates from Hauppauge, New York, with distribution facilities in Earth City (St. Louis), MO and Halton Hills, Ontario. The MARS Equipment Division operates out of Jackson, Michigan, the former headquarters of Heat Controller, Inc.\n¹Excerpts from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

For the U.S. the compliance standard is typically from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). For Canada, a common standard compliance is through the Canada Standards Association Group (CSA). Many times both standards are listed. Regardless, the specific standard will normally be listed on the data tag/plate and followed by the YEAR of the last revision (often the year is placed in parenthesis or follows the hyphen after the specific standard number).

The company began in 1936 as Yaou Shoten Ltd., with first name change in 1955 to Yaou Denki Ltd., and again in 1966 to General Ltd. Fujitsu entered the air conditioning business in 1971 with introduction of \"min min\" cassette air conditioner. Teknika Electronics Co. (currently Fujitsu General America, Inc.) was established as an affiliate in North America in 1975. In 1984, General Ltd. with its various affiliate companies entered into an alliance with Fujitsu. This alliance resulted in the company name change to Fujitsu General Ltd. in 1985, and has continued to expand globally ever since.\n1 (History information from Fujitsu® )\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

Shifts its production emphasis from furnaces to include room air conditioners, central air conditioning, and dehumidifiers under the Comfort-Aire brand name .\n1960's - Heat Controller restructured its furnace line, focusing on residential gas-fired and oil-fired furnaces, while still maintaining an emphasis on the air conditioning portion of the business.\n1972 - Manufactures the first ductless mini-split for the American market - the Comfort-Aire Twin Pak.\n1975 - Heat Controller acquired the Century® brand name and assets, and incorporated those product offerings and market distribution into the Heat Controller family. Century's history dates back to 1917 and continues today to offer a complete line of residential and light commercial heating and air conditioning products.\n1995 - December 1995, Addison Products was acquired by Heat Controller. The new company was called \"Addison Products Co., a division of Heat Controller Inc.\"\n2000 - Heat Controller acquired Aiton's Equipment of Canada , providing increased market penetration in North America. Comfort-Aire and Century brand names were distributed under the new Aiton's of Canada umbrella (\"by Aitons\") throughout Canada.\n2004 - Addison Products Co. a division of Heat Controller Inc. was acquired by Fedders and the name changed to Fedders Addison Co., becoming a new business unit under Fedders Commercial HVAC.\n2013 - MARS (Motors and Armatures, Inc.), a leading commercial and residential HVACR motors and components supplier, acquires Heat Controller, Inc. and forms a merger between the two companies.\nCurrent (2024) - The Heat Controller name was eventually dropped (circa 2016) resulting in two divisions of MARS - the motors and components (parts) division for which MARS was known for, and the MARS equipment division selling under the previous Heat Controller private label brand names of Comfort-Aire, Century, and Allied Commercial. The product lines include an impressively broad selection of HVACR equipment including heat pumps, split system air conditioners, air handlers, furnaces, geothermal, PTACs, portable room air conditioners, dehumidifiers, window air conditioners, ductless systems, commercial Rooftop units, packaged units, and more.\nAbout MARS - Founded in 1945, MARS is a family-owned and operated supplier of motors, components, service/installation parts, and equipment for the HVACR industry. Originally launched as a motor repair company, MARS continually evolved its business throughout the years to meet the needs of customers. Now the MARS Motors and Components Division distributes an extensive line of MARS and JARD branded aftermarket replacement products, as well as original equipment components of leading manufacturers. MARS Equipment Division offers residential and commercial heating, cooling, and dehumidification equipment under the Comfort-Aire and Century brand names in the United States and under the Comfort-Aire by Aitons brand name in Canada. MARS Motors and Components Division operates from Hauppauge, New York, with distribution facilities in Earth City (St. Louis), MO and Halton Hills, Ontario. The MARS Equipment Division operates out of Jackson, Michigan, the former headquarters of Heat Controller, Inc.\n¹Excerpts from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

Originally manufactured steel drums primarily for the oil refinery industry.\n1931 - Rheem began manufacturing automatic gas-fired storage water heaters after 1930 acquisition of Republic Steel who manufactured boilers and related storage tanks.\n1936 - The company expanded overseas to Sydney, Australia. This plant originally made steel shipping containers and drums, but expanded into water heaters by 1939.\n1951 - Rheem purchased the \"Wedgewood\" line of household (small) appliances.\n1954 - Develops \"glass lining\" for its water heaters.\n1956 - Introduces \"Rheemaire\" central air conditioning and heater systems for homes. This eventually became one of the company's primary business areas.\n1959 - Rheem purchased the Ruud Manufacturing Company, further expanding their water heater production.\n1960's - Rheem diversifies further to include manufacture of bathroom fixtures and consumer musical instruments such as electric organs.\n1968 - Rheem introduced its \"Imperial\" forced air gas furnace.\n1968 - A plant was opened in Bergum (Burgum in Frisian) in the Netherlands. The plant was initially successful but had to close its doors by the end of 1983.\n1970 - Rheem opens its air conditioning division in Ft. Smith, Arkansas.\n1971 - Rheem built its water heating division headquarters in Montgomery, Alabama.\n1979 - Rheem added heat pumps to its product line.\n1983 - Rheem introduced the Richmond Water Heaters brand, aimed at hardware stores and home-improvement centers.\n1984 - Rheem was acquired by Pace Industries, Inc. and discontinued manufacture of shipping containers by 1985 - ending 60 years of manufacturing steel drums and similar shipping containers.\n1985 - Rheem expands through acquisition of RayPak, Inc., which expanded the business into swimming pool heaters as well as commercial boilers.\n1988 - Rheem was acquired by Paloma Industries, Ltd., a privately held Japanese company with headquarters in Nagoya, Japan.\n1990 - In a somewhat confusing era and chain of acquisitions, Rheem acquires the \"Weatherking\" line from Addison Products. Addison's Orlando, Florida operation was not part of the transaction. Addison Products Weatherking Division (Orlando) was later acquired by Heat Controller in 1995, and renamed Addison Products Co., a division of Heat Controller Inc. It was later acquired again and owned by Fedders in 2004 until their bankruptcy in 2008. (See Addison history for further info)\n1992 - Rheem introduced the smallest gas furnace line in \u0003the industry.\n1994 - Rheem was the first residential HVAC company to begin using scroll compressors throughout their lineup, and all air conditioners and heat pumps continue to use Copeland Scroll Compressors.\n1997 - The company was first to introduce a 14 SEER remote condensing unit.\n1998 - Rheem introduced the Modulating 90 Plus gas furnace. The company also began supplying Home Depot with a line of GE branded water heaters.\n2009 - Rheem and Ruud were the first to sell a Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater, which was more than twice as efficient as similar electric water heaters. Also in this year, Rheem was first to produce a complete line of 14 SEER condensing units and heat pumps.\n2010 - Rheem introduced a condensing Tankless Water Heater, and the first integrated heating and water heater system with one warranty and manufacturer.\n2012 - Rheem launched the first commercial integrated heating and water heater system.\n2013 - Acquired Heat Transfer Products Group (HTPG), a standalone company which produces the Russell, Witt, ColdZone and Kramer commercial refrigeration brands.\n¹Excerpts from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

Originally manufactured steel drums primarily for the oil refinery industry.\n1931 - Rheem began manufacturing automatic gas-fired storage water heaters after 1930 acquisition of Republic Steel who manufactured boilers and related storage tanks.\n1936 - The company expanded overseas to Sydney, Australia. This plant originally made steel shipping containers and drums, but expanded into water heaters by 1939.\n1951 - Rheem purchased the \"Wedgewood\" line of household (small) appliances.\n1954 - Develops \"glass lining\" for its water heaters.\n1956 - Introduces \"Rheemaire\" central air conditioning and heater systems for homes. This eventually became one of the company's primary business areas.\n1959 - Rheem purchased the Ruud Manufacturing Company, further expanding their water heater production.\n1960's - Rheem diversifies further to include manufacture of bathroom fixtures and consumer musical instruments such as electric organs.\n1968 - Rheem introduced its \"Imperial\" forced air gas furnace.\n1968 - A plant was opened in Bergum (Burgum in Frisian) in the Netherlands. The plant was initially successful but had to close its doors by the end of 1983.\n1970 - Rheem opens its air conditioning division in Ft. Smith, Arkansas.\n1971 - Rheem built its water heating division headquarters in Montgomery, Alabama.\n1979 - Rheem added heat pumps to its product line.\n1983 - Rheem introduced the Richmond Water Heaters brand, aimed at hardware stores and home-improvement centers.\n1984 - Rheem was acquired by Pace Industries, Inc. and discontinued manufacture of shipping containers by 1985 - ending 60 years of manufacturing steel drums and similar shipping containers.\n1985 - Rheem expands through acquisition of RayPak, Inc., which expanded the business into swimming pool heaters as well as commercial boilers.\n1988 - Rheem was acquired by Paloma Industries, Ltd., a privately held Japanese company with headquarters in Nagoya, Japan.\n1990 - In a somewhat confusing era and chain of acquisitions, Rheem acquires the \"Weatherking\" line from Addison Products. Addison's Orlando, Florida operation was not part of the transaction. Addison Products Weatherking Division (Orlando) was later acquired by Heat Controller in 1995, and renamed Addison Products Co., a division of Heat Controller Inc. It was later acquired again and owned by Fedders in 2004 until their bankruptcy in 2008. (See Addison history for further info)\n1992 - Rheem introduced the smallest gas furnace line in \u0003the industry.\n1994 - Rheem was the first residential HVAC company to begin using scroll compressors throughout their lineup, and all air conditioners and heat pumps continue to use Copeland Scroll Compressors.\n1997 - The company was first to introduce a 14 SEER remote condensing unit.\n1998 - Rheem introduced the Modulating 90 Plus gas furnace. The company also began supplying Home Depot with a line of GE branded water heaters.\n2009 - Rheem and Ruud were the first to sell a Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater, which was more than twice as efficient as similar electric water heaters. Also in this year, Rheem was first to produce a complete line of 14 SEER condensing units and heat pumps.\n2010 - Rheem introduced a condensing Tankless Water Heater, and the first integrated heating and water heater system with one warranty and manufacturer.\n2012 - Rheem launched the first commercial integrated heating and water heater system.\n2013 - Acquired Heat Transfer Products Group (HTPG), a standalone company which produces the Russell, Witt, ColdZone and Kramer commercial refrigeration brands.\n¹Excerpts from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

The design was patented in 1890. In October 1890, he expanded on this first water heater design, under the Fuel Gas and Manufacturing Company.\n1897 - Ruud filed a patent separate from the Fuel Gas and Manufacturing Company for an Automatic Water Heater. His new design consisted of a cast iron shell, enclosed burners, heating surfaces (a coil of copper tubing through which water flows), and thermostat controlling gas-valve. The object of the design improvement was, \"to maintain the supply of water at the desired temperature at all times.\"\n1898 - Ruud left the Fuel Gas and Manufacturing Company to start Ruud Manufacturing .\n1908 - Ruud Manufacturing acquired two local heating and plumbing firms - the James Hay Company, heating and plumbing engineers, and Folsom-Webster Co., heating and plumbing contracting firm. Both owners of the acquired firms became president of Ruud Manufacturing and chief of the Cincinnati branch respectively.\n1931 - Rheem began manufacturing automatic gas-fired storage water heaters after 1930 acquisition of Republic Steel who manufactured boilers and related storage tanks.\n1954 - Rheem develops \"glass lining\" for its water heaters.\n1956 - Rheem introduces \"Rheemaire\" central air conditioning and heater systems for homes. This eventually became one of the company's primary business areas.\n1959 - Rheem purchased the Ruud Manufacturing Company, further expanding their water heater production and offerings.\n1960's - Rheem diversifies further to include manufacture of bathroom fixtures and consumer musical instruments such as electric organs.\n1968 - Rheem introduced its \"Imperial\" forced air gas furnace.\n1968 - A plant was opened in Bergum (Burgum in Frisian) in the Netherlands. The plant was initially successful but had to close its doors by the end of 1983.\n1970 - Rheem opens its air conditioning division in Ft.

Unfortunately Slant/Fin closely guarded their numbering system and the manufacturing date could only be determined via contacting their technical assistance directly. Slant/Fin is no longer in business and can no longer be contacted for assistance with the manufacture date of these systems.\nIf an ANSI or CGA code compliance date is present on the rating plate, it may assist you in narrowing down a year range for the system. Additionally, the date stamp on the gas valve may be of assistance, but may only provide an approximate year the gas valve was replaced.\nYou may also be able to use our Hints & Tips page for other helpful clues in determining an approximate manufacture year range.\nSlant/Fin® History¹\n1949 - Company founded by Mel Dubin focusing on baseboard radiators with an original design as a locked, slanted fin - hence the name Slant/Fin\n1965  - Slant/Fin grows to become a nationally-known company and proudly begins operations at its (then) newly constructed location in Greenvale, NY. Slant/Fin markets a marriage between boilers and baseboards for high performance and long-lasting quality. Slant/Fin also expands its baseboard line to begin offering Hydronic boilers - introducing the Galaxy gas boiler and Malibu oil boiler.\n1975 - Slant/Fin revamps its advertising to focus more on style and appearance - featuring a new vinyl clad leathertone baseboard.\n1980 - Slant/Fin expands their line to include the Fine/Line and Multi/Pak series baseboards, and earns trend-setter status in portable heat with the most dependable (at that time) portable baseboard heater built for safety, comfort and durability.\n1985 - Slant/Fin expands factory and introduces the economically-priced and service-friendly XL-2000 oil boiler and the Caravan cast-iron modular boiler system.\n1990 - Introduces \"The Kicker\" - a 14 ½ inch multi-purpose fan convection heater that outputs the heat of a 12 foot hot water baseboard. Also introduces the Victory power-vent gas boiler.\n1995 - Introduces the Liberty boiler - considered unique in shape and performance which frees contractors from virtually all but once-a-year cleaning and burner service.\n2000 - Introduces budget-friendly Base/Line 2000 baseboard which helps contractors win more jobs without compromising on performance or ease of installation. The company focuses on service from this point forward.\n2005 - Introduces the Domestic Hot Water Generator - ideal for the Lynx or VSL Slant/Fin boilers to transfer heat with nearly 100% efficiency. The whisper-quiet \"Eutectic\" earns Slant/Fin recognition for the industry’s quietest boiler.\n2010 - Creates the Victory VSPH power vented boiler - which vents directly through the wall with no chimney required and introduces higher efficiency to the standard cast iron boiler.\n2015 - Launches the premium Decorator Series - the only residential baseboard offered in decorator colors with a hand-painted powder coat including choices of shell white, cloud grey, rubbed bronze, almond, mirror black, flat black, mineral bronze, and bright white. Slant/Fin also introduces the CHS Series condensing high efficiency stainless steel boiler.\n2018 - Expanded the Decorator Series powder Coated baseboard with Revital/Line - an aluminum baseboard replacement cover which slips directly over the back panel of most residential baseboard installed in homes.\n2021 - Experiencing supply chain issues and financial difficulties resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic, Mestek, Inc. purchases the Slant/Fin baseboard assets. Slant/Fin enters into negotiations with U.S. Boiler for the remaining boiler assets.\n2022 - In January, it is announced that Slant/Fin will begin company layoffs while negotiations continue with U.S. Boiler. Slant/Fin plans to continue some manufacturing of a line of boilers with 175-200 employees that were expected to remain. By September of 2022 it is revealed the U.S. Boiler negotiations fell apart and will not continue.\n2023 - In February, Slant/Fin releases electronic communications stating : \"After March 1st Slant/Fin will no longer offer Tech Support. We stopped shipping Slant/Fin Boilers in Aug of 2022. We continued to offer Tech Support through February to allow a chance to sell the boilers and have contractor installation issues resolved. We will continue to support boiler issues with warranties using the forms on our website.  Thank you for your support of our products through the years.\"\n2024 - Slant/Fin places the following written notice on their website: \" Slant/Fin Corp is no longer manufacturing or selling boilers or replacement parts. All Slant/fin boilers are Discontinued Models. Slant/Fin can no longer warranty Beckett, Hydro-Level and Diversified Heat Transfer parts on boilers. All of Slant/Fin's replacement part warranties will expire Aug 1, 2024. For replacement boiler parts, please contact Parts4Heating.com. For Slant/Fin baseboard please contact Mestek\"\n¹Excerpts from various industry sources\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.

We would have to look it up from the serial number and model number which are located inside the unit on the data plate. Once you have the model and serial number, you can fill out the contact form located under the Contact Us tab and in the comment section indicate that you would like to know the date of installation providing the model and serial number as well. You will then get a reply back via the email address you provided on the contact form.\"\nOtherwise, you may be able to estimate the date of manufacture using other clues or date codes from the gas valve, ANSI or CSI or CGA standard revision date, and other helpful clues. For additional tips, please see our Hints and Tips page .\nThe sample data plate below is an example of a Thermo Pride data plate that includes the specific manufacture date. Additionally, further down the data plate (under \"Performance\") is the ANSI Z.21.47 - CAN/CGA 2.3-2006 compliance standard. The year \"2006\" is the ANSI/CGA Standard revision year the unit conforms to. If the unit did not indicate the year of manufacture as 2011 specifically, one would be able to determine that the system could not be any older than 2006 from the year of the Standards revision under Performance Data on the rating plate. These standards are revised approximately every 4-6 years, and so can provide an estimated age range of the system.\nNote: If you have an older system believed to have been manufactured prior to 2005, we have resources that may be able to assist with estimated manufacture year by the model number.

Between 2008-2020 some systems bear the Ingersoll Rand name instead of Trane branding.\n2020 - Ingersoll Rand sold its non-refrigeration businesses via a Reverse Morris Trust transaction to Gardner Denver, rebranding themselves as \"Trane Technologies\" and focusing on their Commercial HVAC, Residential HVAC (Trane) and Refrigeration Transport businesses (Thermo King).\n¹Excerpts from ( Trane® and various other sources )\nEvery effort is undertaken to offer you correct and concise information to assist you in determining the age or manufacture date of HVAC/R equipment.
