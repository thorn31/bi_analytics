# Website Enrichment (Archived)

This folder is **archived** for reference only.

The active enrichment workflow is the unified master enrichment queue:
- `enrichment/README.md`
- `python3 enrichment/build_master_enrichment_queue.py`
- `python3 enrichment/apply_master_enrichment_queue.py`

The original implementation from `website_enrichment/` was moved here so it’s no longer in the repo root.
