## ⚠️ Deferred
| Master Customer | Rationale | Research Narrative |
|---|---|---|
| ENABLE MEDICAL | Ambiguous name | Found multiple medical tech companies with "Enable" in the name in West Chester area. Without a more specific identifier, I cannot determine the correct corporate domain. |
| FAGERDALA PACKAGING | Acquired by Sealed Air | Fagerdala was acquired by Sealed Air in 2017. While the facility exists, there is no standalone domain. |
| FARRAGUT MEDICAL | Location mismatch | Name implies Knoxville, but location is Greer, SC. This discrepancy makes me uncertain about the correct parent entity. |
