## ⚠️ Deferred
| Master Customer | Rationale | Research Narrative |
|---|---|---|
| HIGHPOINT CHURCH | Ambiguous name | Found Kings Point Church in Maineville and High Point Church in Cincinnati. No definitive match for simply Highpoint Church in Maineville without further context. |
| HOPE UNLIMITED CHURCH | Location mismatch | Found campuses in Nashville and Cincinnati, but none specifically in Knoxville as indicated by the example location. |
