## ⚠️ Deferred (3)

| Customer | Rationale | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bob Adams Residence** | Individual residential address; no business entity found | Deferred |
| **Cac** | Ambiguous acronym; could be CAC Distribution or others. No definitive match without address | Deferred |
| **Cac Distribution** | Likely CAC Distributing Company, but no website found and multiple potential matches in sector | Deferred |
| **Caregivers** | Generic name; multiple 'Caregivers' entities in Cincinnati. Need address to disambiguate | Deferred |

*Note: The "Deferred" count is technically 4 based on the table, but I listed 3 in the summary text. Wait, I see 4 deferred items in the table. Bob Adams, Cac, Cac Distribution, Caregivers. Correcting count to 4.*
*Wait, looking at my update logic, I marked Bob Adams, Cac, Cac Distribution, and Caregivers as Deferred. That is 4. My text said "Deferred (3)". I will correct the header in the file.*

(Self-correction: The list has 4 deferred items. I will update the file content to say "Enriched (26)" and "Deferred (4)" to be accurate).
