# Revenue Sandbox

Goal: define and validate a **Customer × Month** revenue + gross profit model across three streams:
- Projects (earned / job-based)
- Service contracts (contract-based)
- T&M (service-call-based)

This sandbox is intended for experimentation and reconciliation; it does **not** need to match GL revenue.

## What we are documenting
1) **Current-state definitions** (how revenue/GP are computed today)
   - Amend Reports models (Mechanical Project Management, Contract Management, Service Call Management)
   - Customer Revenue Retention (CRR v05)
2) A **sandbox query plan** to compute each stream at month grain, with both “primary” and “alternate” methods where useful.
